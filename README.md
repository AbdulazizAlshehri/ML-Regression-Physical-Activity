# ML-Regression-Physical-Activity
This is a machine learning project, that seeks to predict people activity (number of steps) using regression models. Three different models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree) were trained, validated, and tested on data that was collected from the iPhones Health app.

# Data
Three data sources were merged together to end up with one dataset that contain all the needed data for training the model:
1. **Activity Data** : We used data of ~3 years of 2 different persons who live in Riyadh city.
2. **Weather Data** : In addition to the activity data from the health app, we used (web scrapped) the daily weather data of Riyadh city in order to enhance the prediction accuracy.
3. **Vecation Days Data** : Also we scrapped data from the Ministry of Education that shows the vacations days to add more stability to the model predictions.
